## How we share, transfer or make available your personal information

We will share, transfer or make available your personal information as follows:

### 
        We share your personal information with our Service providers.

Tech businesses often use third parties to help them host their application, communicate with customers, power
        their emails
        etc. We partner with third parties who we believe are the best in their field at what they do. These third
        parties
        provide
        the following types of support to us: infrastructure technical services, Analytics services, payment services,
        professional
        advisory services, and data processing for us. The information is disclosed to make available the core
        functions of
        our products
        and/or services. When we do this, sometimes it is necessary for us to share your data with them in order to get
        these services
        to work well. Your data is shared only when strictly necessary and according to the safeguards and good
        practices
        detailed
        in this Privacy Policy.

### We share your personal information with our affiliates.

However, we only share it on a need-to-know basis and will be bound by the purposes stated in the Privacy
        Policy.
        If our
        affiliates are to change the intended purposes for which they use your information, they will notify you in
        advance
        and seek
        your consent if necessary.

### We share your personal information with our partners who commission us to promote.

Sometimes, we market other companies to you. We share your indirect user image formed based on your personal
        information
        in combination with non-personal information with the partner who commissioned us to promote (the "client").
        However, we
        will only provide information on the coverage and effectiveness of the promotion to the client rather than your
        personal
        identity, or we will aggregate this information so that it does not identify you. For example, we can tell the
        client how
        many people saw its promotional information or purchased its products with the marketing information, or
        provided
        them with
        statistical information that could not identify personal identity to help them understand its audience or
        customers.

### we will disclose your information if required by laws, rules, regulations, mandatory administrative
        enforcement
        or judicial
        orders

You understand and agree that Dawn Games may be required to access, monitor and disclose your
        information,
        and the contents
        of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and
        any
        personal
        information) if required to do so by any applicable law or regulation, or in the belief that such disclosure is
        reasonably
        necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not limited to a subpoena, statute,
        search warrant,
        or court order, or to protect the rights or property and rights of Dawn Games or a third party, to protect
        the
        safety
        of our users, the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity Dawn Games may consider to be, or
        to
        pose a risk
        of being, illegal, unethical, criminal or legally actionable, including to report such criminal activity or to
        exchange information
        with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction and other
        security precautions.
        Note that Dawn Games is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena
        or
        other similar
        governmental request that it may receive.

### We will transfer your personal information to companies, organizations or individuals, for mergers,
        acquisitions,
        asset transfer,
        or similar transactions, if personal information is involved in the transfer.

## How we use Cookie and similar technologies

### Use of Cookies

Like many websites, Dawn Games and service providers acting on our behalf, like Google Analytics, store
        log
        files and
        use tracking technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is
        transferred to
        your computer’s hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a
        computer or
        a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to
        personal information
        for purposes such as improving the quality of Dawn Games’s Service, tailoring recommendations to
        interests,
        and making
        the Service easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Services may also use, place or read cookies or other
        technologies
        as described below on your browser, and those practices are subject to their own policies.

Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies, to
        prompt
        you before
        accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate
        differently
        than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If
        you do
        not accept
        cookies, however, you may not be able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the Service.

### Use of similar technologies

We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to
        know
        if a certain
        page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us or our advertising
        partners
        to advertise
        more efficiently and effectively by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying
        the
        source
        of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as
        flash cookies,
        which help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.

    </div>
    <div>

## Links to third parties’ website and applications

The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website
        or
        application
        or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that Dawn Games endorses or
        authorizes
        that third
        party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third
        party
        site
        or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Dawn Games site you are visiting or
        application you
        are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may
        place
        their
        own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal
        information
        from you.
        Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information
        you
        submit
        to them. Because Dawn Games cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept
        responsibility
        for the
        content of these third party services, any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it
        cannot
        guarantee
        that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Dawn Games. You are therefore
        encouraged
        to read
        the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal
        information.

        purposes.

We store information about players and visitors to our sites on servers located in the People's Republic of
        China,
        and we
        may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries. Personal data collected within the
        European
        Economic Area (“EEA”) may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the EEA. The data we hold
        may
        also be
        processed by employees operating outside of the EEA who work for us or one of our Affiliates or for one of our
        vendors. This
        staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details and
        (ii)
        the provision
        of support services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps
        to
        ensure that
        your personal information is treated securely, lawfully and in the manner we describe here. Please note that
        laws
        vary from
        jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is
        transferred to or
        stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are
        resident.

We comply with the EU Data protection regulation, and the local Data Protection Authorities’ guidelines, in
        the
        countries
        we operate, regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member
        countries.
